This is a first attempt to keep the API used by the editor separate from the main rails
application. This does not yet setup the required routes and there is a certain amount of 
overlap (PageElement model is defined in the application and not here).

However, creating new TextElements or PageElements is done here: the views and the models
are defined here.
